Meteor is the toolchain of my choice.
It offers a complete environment for package management and build tools.
It is entirely possible to adapt it to a client-only angular application.

to run this project you need to install the meteor toolkit
https://www.meteor.com/
```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

after that you can start this project form the root and run meteor
```
meteor
```
